        <h3>Charlene Luke, Owner</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Charlene. I have been grooming since 2010. I grew up with dogs and cats. I love all animals and have had horses, goats, chickens, rabbits, lizards, and frogs as pets. üêæ
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to grooming I graduated from college and worked in the medical field as an Ophthalmic Technician. I decided to make dog grooming an official career in 2011. I opened my business in Magnolia that year shortly after completing the academy, where they taught all breed standards of grooming, safety, and dog behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          I temporarily closed The Grooming Spot from approximately 2022 through mid-summer of 2025 while recovering from back and hand surgery. I am happy to be fully recovered and back to work doing what I love! üíõ
        </p>
        <p>
          The business is now mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Grooming Spot @ your spot! üòä üêæ
        </p>
